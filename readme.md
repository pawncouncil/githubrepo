This is the contentss of my githubrepo folder. Not entirely sure what you are asking of me in here. 
I used the terminal to open a new githubrepo file. 
Then I linked to the GitHub site and modified this readme file. then i added it and commited it then viewed it on github. Now I am about to upload it and go home. 
That's all!
